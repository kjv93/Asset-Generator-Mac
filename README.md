# What Is It?

Asset Generator is a Mac app which takes design assets and adds them to your Xcode project's Xcassets library. Its goal is to bridge the gap between designers and developers: the former can pull project repositories and update assets without bothering the developers in a hopefully intutive way.

Drag a folder or multiple image files onto the left well, drag an Xcodeproject file onto the right well and hit **Build**.

# About

Asset Generator is a collaboration between [Bader Alabdulrazzaq](https://twitter.com/BHAlRezzaga), iOS engineer who graciously greeted Sourcebits for an internship in late 2014, and Sourcebits' Chief Innovation Officer [Piotr Gajos](https://twitter.com/Pe8er). App icon was designed by Sourcebits' senior interaction designer, Rick Patrick.

The app was designed in Sketch, written in Swift and released under the [GNU GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) license.

We would like to thank all Sourcebits developers and designers who helped us with feature ideas and relentless bug reports.
